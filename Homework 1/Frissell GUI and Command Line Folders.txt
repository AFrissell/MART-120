Having had this MacBook for the last five years, I am pretty familiar with the interface and how to navigate through folders and create files. It was overall pretty easy and I was comfortable through the process. The Command Line Interface was much more confusing and left me struggling to figure out exactly what to do and how to do it. I found out how to open the terminal on macs (it wasn’t too difficult) and then tried to work through the provided pdf as best as possible. It was pretty confusing, as I’m naturally not used to the vocabulary used. I honestly felt really adrift trying to sort through the provided information and work through commands through the terminal. It was a very slow and pretty frustrating process. I’m sure once I grow more familiar with this it’ll get less difficult, but for the first time, it was a very negative experience that left me feeling more confused than anything. I do think I started to piece things together.  It was kind of interesting working through changing file names and making changes through the terminal. The Unix For the Begining Mage was just a lot of information dumped and left me feeling discouraged and a bit lost. Overall, for now, I strongly prefer the GUI as I can see what I’m doing and I don’t have to figure out the commands and work through a load of information with unfamiliar terminology and programs. Of course, as stated before, that might change in the future.
