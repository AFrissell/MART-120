            The Howling Man of The Bitteroot Mountains </span></h1>
<span>
        <p>In the great woods and mountains of Montana lives a howling man. From his back hangs two skis,</p>
        <p>from his side hangs bear spray (for he is no foolish hiker).</p>
        <p>He wanders the mountains, living amongst bears and other creatures.</p>
        <p>Nobody knows the hills better than he. He's walked them a thousand times with leathered bare feet.</p>
        <p>Every year hikers get lost in winter storms, out of cellular range and beyond the reach of roads.</p>
        <p>The howling man of woods seeks them out and bring them to safety. His fur is thick, his beard is wild.</p>
        <p>He has no need for coats, for his natural hair warms him enough, with thick tuffs of brown.</p>
        <p>Entire ecosystems live in his brown mop. Things that crawl, slither, and fly.</p>
        <p>He's seen the mountains shrink and grow. He speaks to trees and rocks and earns their wisdon with patience.</p>
        <p>He feeds from berries and from fungus that grows beneath rocks. He lives to be alive.</p>
        <p>When snow melts he walks his way into town and works as a cashier at the local gas station</p>
        <p>in the early morning when only truckers and delivery men wander awake.</p>
        <p>To the night owls,they hear only his howls late into the night.</p>
