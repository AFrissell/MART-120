This week we didn't make anything, only learned the basics of folder organization, <br>
introduced ourselves, and learned how to work with GitHub for the first time! I had some <br>
struggles with Github, but figured it out in time to do it correctly for Week 2!
</br>
<h2> 
Week 2

</br>
This week we watched "The Last Lecture", learned about learning styles, <br>
played through Dance Party Hour of Code, then finally created a work of art using code, <br>
as seen above! We did this in Artist Lab, and it helped establish the logical thinking <br>
one must use when coding! As you may see, this image tells the epic tale of a Wizard, <br>
and Witch dualing the spirits of darkness, including three dragons (though they are only <br>
the size of a housecat each, they can breate enough fire to roast a marshmellow!) In this <br>
epic fantasy adventure there is romance, tragedy, and a scale of adventure that would <br>
rival even the greatest stories of Tolkien and the other great fantasy literary authors.

</br>
This week we talked about grit, and the idea of pushing past hard challenges. To pair <br>
with that, we made our first "game". My game was about a frog contemplating the wonders <br>
of blinking. It was certainly a challenge, even with just drag and drop, and had me thinking <br>
more about how code must be structured to work properly. Sadly, the link for the project will <br>
not open, and I cannot get a visual of this week. I seemingly can't even open Cassen's example <br>
for this project. It seemingly exists only in memory now. It was a simple game, that really was <br>
just an interactive conversation between a frog and a bat in the woods outside a party. Without <br>
any access to visuals of this project, I have included my grit score. I have MORE GRIT than 30% <br>
of Americans. I have always felt I should belong amongst the top 70%, and here is undeniable <br>
PROOF that I have GRIT. Which is why I have sent this screenshot to almost everyone I know. 
</br>
<h2> 
Week 4
</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/AFrissell/MART-120/tree/main/Homework%204">Github Week 4 Link</a><br>
<img src="Week 4 Image.png" height="350" width="220">
<img src="Week 4 App.png" height="350" width="200">
</br>
This week we did a number of things, from making a little game, to creating a simple application. <br>
Once again, as you can see with my game, I am following with the theme of great spirits and epic <br>
cat-sized dragons in my new great work, Secret Guardian. This is largely based on the illustrative <br>
masterpiece of my Week 2, but making it more interactive. It was really interesting to learn how to <br>
attatch controls to key pressing, to allow movement. As well as putting in code to make the dragons <br>
flee the raw anger and terror of my spirit protagonist. Together, it created the epic story of an <br>
unnamed secret spirit that protets humanity from monsterous dragonlike gargoyles. The gameplay is <br>
sophisticated, with artifical intelligence and three unique dialogue options for each of the <br>
gargoyles you vanquish. <br>
Additionally, we made an app, which was less fun but still interesting as we had to figure out the <br>
logic behind creating something from an idea in our heads. In my case, I went with something <br>
practical, a german translation quizzer, so you can test yourself on the German versions of English <br>
words! Keep an eye out, this one might be topping the app store charts here in a few weeks.

Genuinely really enjoyed making the 3D setting in Alice for the odd little game we made this week.<br>
Mine is especially strange, as you play as a rabbit an odd purgatory like setting, talking to demons, <br>
lost spirits, and a talking goat, who is seemingly Lucifer. I enjoyed figuring out how to make a first-<br>
person camera that follows the character, looking over the shoulder. You interact by clicking characters, <br>
or by physically colliding with them for additional dialog options. Definitely a Halloweeny game for the <br>
season it was made.

</br>
Over the course of these three weeks, we built the web pages seen linked here! You can access the other <br>
pages at the bottom of the screen. On week six, we learned some of the basics of javascript by learning <br>
how to make hyperlinks. I atatched some funky websites I know about, as well as some restauraunts. We also <br>
learned how to add images, create checkboxes that you can interact with, linked the pages together, and more! <br>
</br>
In week seven we expanded on the previous week, building these webpages by adding styles to make the pages <br>
more visably appealing. This means changing fonts, font colors, etc. We learned how to work with external <br>
style sheets, how to use ID selectors, reference Bootstrap, create background images, and more! This is where <br>
the webpages started to become more visually flashy, as they are now. Though, admitedly, the styles vary quite <br>
a lot through these pages, to fit the criteria for our homeworks. Still, they look a lot better than boring plain <br>
boring text! I reall enjoyed creating the background for <a href="Page 2.html">Page 2!</a><br>
<br>
Finally, in Week 8, we finished these webpages, making them even more interactive! The primary focus for this week was <br>
<a href="Page 3.html">Page 3</a>, where we made the boxes turn red if the email or name wasn't filled in. Additionally, <br>
we learned how to make it so the user gets a pop up message if they don't agree to the terms of service. While I am more <br>
interested in the creative side of this class, this stuff also interests me. They are additional tools to have at my <br>
disposal in my future creative projects. My main focus is interactive art, and games are the best means for that. However, <br>
websites also have a similar potetntial. When working on these weeks, I found myself wondering how I could make an artistic <br>
website using the interactive tools we learned in class. Now, in retrospect with even more javascript, there is certainly <br>
potential for such a project. Though, it would take time and I'd need a good idea before jumping into something like that! <br>

</br>
This week is when things really started to feel like they were clicking for me. In this week, we learned how to add basic <br>
shapes in Javascript, through the use of p5.js. I really enjoyed figuring out where things can go, and as you can see, I <br>
spent a fair bit of time on this. I liked thinking about the layering, it's a lot like laying something in an art program, <br>
and it is super interesting seeing how that could be done through code. Color was especially interesting, as this was really <br>
the first time I've encountered creating colors through code alone, using RGB. While it still alludes me a little, I feel like <br>
I have a better understanding of how computers see color, which is a weird and interesting thing as a digital artist. I had extra <br>
time this week, and as such I fleshed out this image, trying to capture some likeness. Though for the sake of simplicity I gave <br>
myself a cartoonish looking crown, with basic shapes. I really enjoyed learning how to place all the basic shapes, and I had fun <br>
with this project, proving that indeed, coding can be fun! Because through it, one can create! And that is super cool to me!
</br>
<img src="Week 10 Pic.png" height="350" width="200"><br>
<a href="main.html">Link to animated file!</a>
</br>
Week 10 was pretty straightforward, we simply learned how to move the objects we created in Week 9! I once again really enjoyed <br>
this, especially as someone who enjoyes animation! Animation is so incredibly time consuming that this alternative form of animation <br>
is especially noteworthy! It really got my creative juices flowing in how to animate a game. It leads to some natural questions on what <br>
should be animated by hand, turned into a sprite sheet, and uploaded, and what should be animated through code. Animating through code <br>
is interactive, and I could imagine using it for making characters heads move to follow the player, and things like that. Anything that <br>
is stiff, without need for the organic movemenet of hand animation could also be animated through programming. I'm curious if there is a <br>
performance difference between using sprite animations or programmed animations. Are sprite animations more intenseive? How many characters <br>
can share a screen before performance issues start to occur? I imagine the more characters you have doing their own individual things, the <br>
more work a computer has to do. Is this something I should be thinking about when I'm creating my own 2D games, or have computers gotten <br>
powerful enough to handle that kind of thing for 2D games? These are all thoughts I will be keeping in mind as we dive further into the world <br>
of programming next semester!

</br>
The discussion of week 11, when is it okay to use other's work, was particularly interesting to me. When developing games, there are so many <br>
different elements. As an artist, it's tempting to try and build an entire game completely from scratch. But that is a tremendous amount of <br>
work. I may be able to do the artwork and programming, but it is difficult to do something like sound or music given my relative lack of <br>
experience with that medium. but music is such a tremendous part of games, or really, any animation. Animation can be dramatically elevated <br>
by good sounds. So if I don't have the skills, how can I get good sound? Do I use free online resources? What are their quality? Should I get pay <br>
someone else to do it? How much do I pay them? How should they be credited, and who owns the rights to the music if it's made for a game? This is <br>
just one example, but I would love to learn more about ownership as we move forward, especially in regards to premade music or prebuilt code from <br>
online libraries. The last thing I'd want to do is spend a sizable fraction of my life creating a game that has copyright violations! <br>
<br>
Over the course of these 3 weeks, we built our first game in javascript, though we never did get to collisions. Regardless, I really loved building <br>
this from the code up, something about building games from scratch, even ugly ones, is satisfying as a creator. Looking at the complex structures of <br>
the code, compared to the relatively clean simple game is really interesting. It really does feel like building invisable webs of interactions to apply <br>
to art (or in this case, basic shapes.) It once again made me excited about programming as a tool as a means to elevate art to not only be animated, <br>
but also be interactive. This is a whole new level of creation, and one that I am so excited to learn more about! Though the game we made was pretty <br>
basic, and lacks decent visuals, I could picture how to create a complex maze. With collisions, one could take damage by touching walls, pushing the <br>
player into precise movements to navigate a level. While this isn't the kind of gameplay I personally enjoy or want to make, the fact that we're getting <br>
to create what resembles a game is incredibly exciting! Though simple, I tried to give my game a color pallete of gray and red, to remain kind of <br>
aesthetic. I also made a quick simple sword decoration to fit in with the title. It's small but fun! <br>
<br>
Week 12 was a breeze, as all we had to do was condense our previous work into functions, both for the sake of better organization, as well as ease of <br>
editing. This week's information about maintence was especially insiteful, because I feel that when I finally get to building my own games, making <br>
them easy to return to and edit is a big deal. Especially when I'm learning. I'll want to come back, tweak things as I learn, make sure that things still <br>
run over time, etc. Though it was easy, it was otherwise a crazy busy week for me, so I appreciated the simple task of the week, it allowed me to survive <br>
another week without getting overwhelmed. The conversation on diversity was also really interesting, and I enjoyed reading what my classmates had to say. <br>
It's a big topic but an important one, and I really appreciate Cassen's emphasis on diversity. I later went to his lecture on diversity in online classes, <br>
which relates perfectly to this discussion! It got me thinking about how I can use my future projects, including my games, to solve social issues. This is <br>
something that I personally care a lot about, so I would love to learn more! <br>
<br>
Week 13 was break, and so we didn't have class. Over this time, however, I started to think about a future game project I am interested in, a simple side <br>
scroller with a strong emphasis on story. This side scroller would be in the style of a medieval manuscript, and while I want to keep gameplay mechanics <br>
to keep the code simple, I want to go crazy with the art, andimation, writing, and sound! Night in the Woods is one of my favorite games, and I love how <br>
it incorporates social issues, from labor to LGBTQ+ acceptence, in a way that blends so nicely with the characters and story. I want to learn from that and <br>
find ways to subvert my medieval setting by incorporating some modern social issues. I'll need to take my time with the writing to make sure that I am being <br>
thoughtful with my themes and characters. <br>

<img src="Week 14 image.png" height="250" width="300"><br>
<a href="MainGame.html">Link to game!</a> <br>
In Week 13 we also worked on random obstacles. This was really interesting to me, trying to create randomness in code. Thankfully, it wasn't <br>
too difficult with the tools Cassens provides. The aestehtic of the obstacles is pretty unique, like meteors flying across the screen. I also added some basic <br>
"collisions" to game, though I am sure that what I did isn't the correct way. It also only works for the world borders. I just made it so that the player cannot <br>
escape off the edges of the sceen by flying through the wall. Instead, the player is teleported instantly to the pixel before the edge. of course, there is a gap <br>
for the exit to allow the playr through. It works pretty well, but I can't figure out how to use the same logic to create collisions on curved, moving, or diagnol <br>
surfaces. I'll just need to be patient until next semester when we are provided more tools to work with collisions. <br>
<br>
Finally, in Week 14 (or homework 14), we finished the semester by learning about arrays. Admitedly, this was a pretty stressful week as final projects were due, and so <br>
I was more frantic in trying to understand arrays and get the assignment complete so that I could move on to my pressing projects. That is never an ideal learning <br>
enviorment, so I was thankful to find that this week was relatively easy, much like the functions week. Simply, all we had to do was convert our code for the random <br>
flying objects so that we could easily change certain characteristics. From size, color, to the amount that appear on screen at once. I absoluetly see the appeal of <br>
using arrays, and I am curious how they apply to other projects. Since we've only made this one project, it's hard for me to figure out how these abstract fundemental <br>
concepts apply to creating other kinds of games, such as ones with a moving camera. I am excited to learn more about these ideas in the context of other programs, <br>
especially unity. Though I am sure there are a lot more fundmentals to master before trying to bring these elements together into one cohesive whole in Unity. <br>
</br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Without my usual studio classes this semester, this class became something of a creative outlet for me. I really enjoyed not only learning how to use such a <br>
technical tool as programming, and thinking about ways to use this new tool to elevate my art. I have always been inteimidating by programming, and told by <br>
people that I should avoid it, because it is boring and "painful" to do. Thankfully, this class has made programming very accessible. We are learning slowly, <br>
but that makes it less of a big scary topic. The opening weeks really eased us in, introducing us to the logical mindset of programming through drag and drop <br>
projects. We learned some basic webpage design, as well as the very start to how one might build a game in javascript. Programming has gone from a big intimidating <br>
mountain, to something that I feel I can learn. I am excited about the creative oppertunities with these new skills. I chose to do this portfoilo option for the <br>
final, as I feel it is really useful to go back and review what we learned to understand how it all works together. This doc will help me at the start of next <br>
semester, by providing an easy resource for me to access old assignments, as well as my own thoughts.
